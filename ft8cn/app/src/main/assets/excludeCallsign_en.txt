Filtering - hide by prefixes
You can enter a list of prefix that separated by comma "," or space " ". FT8CN will loop up callsigns by your predefined prefixes and hide them from the Calling list.

This filter has the highest priority, which will override any entry from "Tracked Callsign", "CQ", and "about me".
