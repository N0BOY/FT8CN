About Empty the Cache:
FT8CN keeps the tracked callsign list and QSO decoding log in a cache file. You can permanently remove them using empty cache option. Note that clearing cache won't delete any QSO log.

Clear Tracked callsign list:
Tracked callsign list contains all your favorite callsigns. When a tracked callsign shows up, it will be added to the calling message for quick or auto call.   

Note that clearing tracked callsign list will remove all saved favorite callsigns.

Clean "cached QSO decoding":
FT8CN saves all decoded entries during your QSO. It doesn't display on the UI, but can be accessed for debugging and troubleshooting. You can clean it regularly if not interested in any debugging.
